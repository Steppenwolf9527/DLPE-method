This repository provides the predictive model described in the paper:

Longxi Zhou, et al. "Seeing the Unseen: Discovering Interpretable Sub-Visual Abnormalities in CT Scans of COVID-19 Patients and Survivors by Deep Learning"
```

## Description
Deep-LungParenchyma-Enhancing (DLPE) is a computer-aided detection (CADe) method for detecting and quantifying pulmonary parenchyma lesions on chest computerized tomography (CT). Using deep-learning, DLPE removes irrelevant tissues other than pulmonary parenchyma, and calculates the scan-level optimal window which enhances parenchyma lesions for dozens of times compared to the lung window. Aided by DLPE, radiologists discovered novel and interpretable lesions from COVID-19 inpatients and survivors, which are previously invisible under the original lung window and have strong predictive power for key COVID-19 clinical metrics and sequelae.

### Example Data on the Google Drive:
The trained models of DLPE method and the example chest CT raw data are stored on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16ZvZfhqMmuF7wqNPKUOntw2P-Mfx5C4l?usp=sharing). Download the file: "trained_models" and "example_data" on the Google Drive and put the contents in your computer.

### How to run the model
