## Usage

### Download Data
Download Data from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_-W8HcHpnBS_9Hkz6P5QfE6Gw-pNXxZ7?usp=sharing). Place the folders `datasets/` and `checkpoint/` in the repository folder.

### Run

Run command
```
python test.py
```
You probably need to install relavant dependencies.

### Output

The 3D prediction result will be stored in `prediction/`. Viewable png slices of the array will be stored in `prediction_visualization/`.
